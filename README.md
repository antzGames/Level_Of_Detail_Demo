# libGDX Level Of Detail Demo

This is a small desktop (Linux/Windows) compatible demo that shows the FPS
difference between stock libGDX 3D and my **Level of Detail** (LOD) solution.

3D Models and LOD meta data were generated by my tool, GLTF LOD Generator, available 
for free for Linux/Windows users at: https://antzgames.itch.io/libgdx-meshoptimizer

## Controls

**L** KEY
Toggles the LOD engine on/off.  This will allow you to see the **FPS difference** the LOD
engine provides, and how slow libGDX is by default.

**WASD** KEYS
This allows you to move the camera.

**MOUSE**
This allows you to rotate the camera.

**R** KEY
Resets the camera to its default position.

**ESC** KEY
Exits the application.

## How to use this engine in my projects?

This project uses `gdx-gltf`.

Copy the `dto` and `gdxgltf` packages to your project, or just use this project as a template.

You need to use the `LODScene` class instead of gdx-gltf's Scene class.
You need to use the `LODSceneManager` class instead of gdx-gltf's SceneManager class.

Here are the two new methods that you need to use:

To load the LOD meta data file:
```java
    SceneAsset sceneAsset = new GLTFLoader().load("path to GTLF file");
    LoDScene scene = new LoDScene(sceneAsset.scene);
    scene.loadLoDs(Gdx.files.internal("path to lod meta data file")); // NEW!!! load meta file
```

To update the LODs in `render()`
```java
    sceneManager.update(delta);
    sceneManager.updateLoDs(); // NEW!!! check if LoDs need updating
    sceneManager.render();
```

Look at provided source code for more information.
